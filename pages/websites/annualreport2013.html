          I <em>cannot</em> believe this exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not because it's hard to believe someone pays me and my coworkers to make this kind of stuff, though that's often unbelievable. But because this launched the first week of 2014, and two weeks into December, 2013, we still didn't have a solid grasp of what it was going to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't for lack of trying. We had a few different ideas, I'd mocked up several of them, and we'd actually developed fully functioning prototypes. A few worked well, but they didn't feel like the right solutions for us that year.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, on Monday, December 16, we changed gears completely. Austin came up with the idea of positioning our year as a countdown, and we started compiling numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          I came into work on the 17th not knowing what do. I'd been working on the project off and on for over a month. I sat down and read a book, sat there for a few minutes, and made this sketch.
        </p>

          By 11:00 AM, I'd produced a PSD, and some GIFs to go along with it.
        </p>

          I like to mock up interactions of my designs. It seems to streamline the development process when I'm able to visually represent my ideas.

          As you can see, the finished product often changes, but it's a great way to start the conversation about how a static design translates to the screen.

          If you're familiar with American holidays, you'll recognize that the end of December is normally not the best time for finishing projects. We started this direction and finished the project in two weeks, two weeks that included weekends, Christmas, and New Years. We compiled numbers, finalized copy, produced imagery, and developed a site in just a few days. It was a pretty fantastic run, with everyone on the marketing pitching in and helping make it happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site was really received, which was validating for all of us at the time. But the success of the annual report in 2012 was the reason creating one in 2013 became such a burden. We felt like we need to top what had been done before. With the end of 2014 looming, the question becomes, "Can we do it again?" Guess we'll see in a few months.
